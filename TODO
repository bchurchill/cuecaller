Here are some ideas to work on:

* Right now the default music player is always mplayer.  It would be nice to create an install script that gave the user a choice or searched the system for good players.
* How about a global defaults file for settings?
* More escape sequences for the label files?
* More integration for fades?  Like perhaps a little slider bar that moves across the screen as the fade completes?
